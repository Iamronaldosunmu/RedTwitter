# RedTwitter

## My front-end twitter clone
### Live-site-url: https://iamronaldosunmu.github.io/RedTwitter/
##### I am extremely happy that I was able to work on this. 🎉🎉🎉
##### I started the project shortly after the twitter ban in Nigeria, I was on the phone with one of my friends and then he asked me if I could build twitter with everything I had learnt so far 😅😅. I took on the challenge and I am glad with how it turned out 😁😁😁.
##### The project took me a total of 150+ hours over the span of two months but I'm glad that I was able to complete it.
##### I made sure that I built it using only plain html, css, and vanilla JS. Even though there were many frameworks at my disposal, I really wanted to practice the fundamentals.
##### I encountered so many problems and errors while working on this project 😅. But I was able to to solve all of them. This really improved my confidence and I think I am slowly getting rid of imposter syndrome.
##### I implemented many features like light mode and dark mode, the ability to like, retweet and share tweets, the ability to go to different screens, the ability to tweet, filter chats and current trends etc.
##### I gained a lot of valuable experience from this project and I'll really like it if you can send me a chat on twitter telling me what you think.
##### Please retweet my tweet about this project on twitter to show support https://twitter.com/IamRonald05/status/1448577416578883587?s=20
